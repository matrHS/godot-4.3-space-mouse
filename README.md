# Forked from MrVolans and recompiled for Godot 4.3

- Bundled library is only compiled for windows, feel free to contribute libraries for other platforms.
- only supports perspective mode, inputs are disabled while in orthogonal projection mode due to bugs
- Updates will be slow, as I had no GDExtension experience prior to this project.

## Building from source 
You need Scons, godot-cpp (GDExtension) and the HIDAPI library

Update the bundeled Sconstruct to locate the HIDAPI library you downloaded, and build the godot-cpp repo to create the headers for GDExtension.

Then build the Spacemouse sconstruct.

The library will be placed inside the addons/bin ready to be used.

lastly update the spacemouse.GDExtension to include the path for the library suited for your platform. 

When building with Scons it is likely that the libraries will be placed under "spacemouse_test/addons/spacemouse", if not they will be located under "addons/bin"
